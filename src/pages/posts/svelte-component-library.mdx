## Create a new SvelteKit project

If you frequently have components that you share between projects and want to keep a single repository of them, you can create a package on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) like [this one](https://github.com/rossrobino/components). Here's how to create a [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) component library with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev).

## Configure

### Setup

-   Navigate to a directory in your terminal where you will create your project
-   Run `npm create svelte@latest`, configure your project with the CLI, select the `Library skeleton project` template
-   Update `README.md` with information about your project

### Project information

Since this is a library project, it's important to add in your relevant information to the `package.json` file so it will appear in npm when the package is published. Since we are building a Svelte component library, we will add `svelte` as a `"peerDependency"`.

```json
{
	"name": "@rossrobino/components",
	"version": "0.0.1",
	"description": "A reusable Svelte component library",
	"keywords": [
		"components",
		"documentation",
		"Svelte",
		"SvelteKit"
	],
	"homepage": "https://components.robino.dev",
	"license": "MIT",
	"author": {
		"name": "Ross Robino",
		"url": "https://robino.dev"
	},
	"repository": "github:rossrobino/components",
	"scripts": {
		"dev": "vite dev",
		"build": "vite build", // change build script
		"packageBuild": "svelte-kit sync && svelte-package", // add packageBuild script
		...
	},
	"peerDependencies": {
		"svelte": "^3.55.1"
	},
	...
```

### Build scripts

Optional: As you can see above, we can change the `build` script to `vite build` and create a new script `packageBuild: "svelte-kit sync && svelte-package"`. This comes in handy if you are wanting to use this same project to build a web app (I used mine to build a [docs site](https://components.robino.dev) for my components). This way, tools like [Vercel](https://vercel.com) can still build and deploy without any extra configuration.

If you just want to use the project for the package only you can skip these changes. Run `npm run build` instead of `npm run packageBuild` for this tutorial.

## lib directory

The contents of the `src/lib` directory are what will be packaged upon running `npm run packageBuild`. This is where components can reside for the project as well as an `index.js` file that exports the components for the package.

## Create a component

Create a component to export in your package, here's my `YouTube.svelte` component as an example.

```svelte
<!-- src/lib/svelte/YouTube.svelte -->

<script>
	let className = "";
	let idName = "";
	export { className as class, idName as id };
	export let uid;
	export let title = "";
</script>

<iframe
	class={className}
	id={idName}
	src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/{uid}"
	{title}
	frameborder="0"
	allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
	allowfullscreen
/>
```

## Export

Import and export the component from `src/lib/index.js`.

```js
// src/lib/index.js

import YouTube from "./svelte/YouTube.svelte";

export { YouTube };
```

## Test locally

Do a quick test of your component on `src/routes/+page.svelte` by importing it to the page and running `npm run dev -- --open`.

```svelte
<!-- src/routes/+page.svelte -->

<script>
	import YouTube from "$lib/svelte/YouTube.svelte";
</script>

<YouTube
    uid="gouiY85kD2o"
    title="Renegade - Kevin Olusola"
/>
```

Ensure that the component is working as expected, then you are ready to create a package.

## Package

Now we can package the library and publish it on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for anyone to use. Repeat these steps each time you want to update your package.

-   Set the `version` in `package.json`, this will have to be bumped up each time you publish the package (major.minor.patch)--you can leave this at `0.0.1` to start
-   Run `npm install` to sync your `package-lock.json` with the current version information
-   Run `npm run packageBuild` to execute the `svelte-package` script
-   You can verify the output of your build in the `package` directory
-   Commit changes to your repository
-   Run `npm publish --access public ./package` to publically publish your package on npm (if you don't have an account you will need to create one and log in)

## Test in a separate project

After verifying on the npm website that your package has been published, you can now use your package in a separate project.

-   Set up a new SvelteKit project or use a different existing one
-   Run `npm install -D yourPackageName` to install it as a dev dependency
-   Import in `src/routes/+page.svelte` like before, but edit the import path to point to your package instead
-   Lastly, run `npm run dev -- --open` to see your imported component in action

```svelte
<!-- src/routes/+page.svelte -->

<script>
	import YouTube from "@rossrobino/components";
</script>

<YouTube
    uid="gouiY85kD2o"
    title="Renegade - Kevin Olusola"
/>
```

## Conclusion

You have now built a Svelte component library you can access from any of your other SvelteKit projects to share code between them.

You can check out [my library](https://github.com/rossrobino/components) as an example or fork it to create your own version. It has a [documentation website](https://components.robino.dev) included in the same project to make updates easier.

Thanks for reading!
